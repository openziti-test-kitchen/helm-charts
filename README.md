### Automatic process coming soon

Based on the process established by https://netfoundry.github.io/charts - this repo will
be updated at some point similarly

Merge changes to branch "main" to trigger the GitHub Action that runs the Helm releaser script.
 This is configured in the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file. This will also merge the necessary 
 index to `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages to publish. You may verify the rebuild completed by 
 noting the presence of your update in https://netfoundry.github.io/charts/index.yaml. Then you may 
 use the update in Helm.

```bash
> helm repo update && helm search repo openziti --versions

Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
